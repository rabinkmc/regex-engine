[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
(Regexes, for short) are patterns used to match character combinations in
strings. [`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) is a CLI tool for
searching using Regexes.


["Build Your Own grep" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/grep/overview). 
The aim of the project is to learn about Regex syntax, how parsers/lexers work, and how regular
expressions are evaluated.

1. Ensure you have `python (3.11)` installed locally
2. Run `./your_grep.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `app/main.py`.
